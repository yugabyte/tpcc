## Prerequisites:
Yugabyte cluster is deployed and is reachable.
TPCC client nodes are deployed and they can communicate with the Yugabyte cluster.
A client-manager machine that can run this script and has access to the Yugabyte cluster and the TPCC client nodes.

## Step 1. Create the Loader and execute scripts. 
First create 2 text files for clients and yugabyte nodes named `clients.txt` and `yb_nodes.txt`.
The file `yb_nodes.txt` needs the master node ips to be present first followed by the other ips.

## Step 2. Configure the client nodes.
This can be done as follows. Make sure that the environment has the ssh user
exported to the variable `SSH_USER` and the additional SSH AND SCP arguments
like the pem file or the port exported as `SSH_ARGS` and `SCP_ARGS`.
```sh
./setup_clients.sh
```

## Step 3. Modify variable and compile the program to run TPCC.
The variables that need to be modified are in the beginning of the cpp file.
They are:

1. total_warehouses:          This variable controls the total number of warehouses. 
                              The number of warehouses that each client works on is a factor of this quantity and the number of clients.
2. num_ips_per_client:        The number of ips supplied to each client.
3. client_repeat_count:       The number of clients that is given the same set of ips.
                              When num_ips_per_client is 3 and client_repeat_count is 2:
			      First client will get 3 YB node ips: ip1, ip2, ip3
			      Second client will get the same 3 YB node ips: ip1, ip2, ip3
			      Third client will get the next 3 YB node ips: ip4, ip5, ip6
			      Fourth client will also get the same 3 YB node ips: ip4, ip5, ip6
4. loader_threads_per_client: The number of threads used for loading per client.
5. num_connections_per_client:The number of connections used during the execute phase by each client.
5. delay_per_client:          The amount of delay between the start of consecutive clients during the execute phase.
			      When delay_per_client is 30:
			      First client starts at delay 0
			      Second client starts with a delay of 30 seconds
			      Third client starts with a delay of 60 seconds and so on.
6. load_delay_per_client:     Similar to the earlier variable but for the load phase.
7. ignore_masters:            Whether we have to ignore the master ips {The first 3 ips in the yb_nodes.txt file} during the load/execute phase. 
8. ssh_args:                  The additional options needed to login to the client nodes.
9. ssh_user:                  The user used to login to the client nodes.

Now compile the program:
```sh
g++ --std=c++11 run_tpcc_on_clients.cpp -o run_tpcc_on_clients
```

## Step 4. Create the TPCC tables.
This can be done from by:
```sh
./run_tpcc_on_clients create
```

## Step 5. Load the data.
This can be done by:
```
./run_tpcc_on_clients load
```

## Step 6. Enable the foreign keys.
This can be done as:
```sh
./run_tpcc_on_clients enable-foreign-keys
```

## Step 7. Execute the program.
This can be done as:
```sh
./run_tpcc_on_clients execute
```
This script creates an output file per client in /tmp/ directory with each clientâ€™s ip as part of the name of the output file.

If you do need to kill the currently running program at any stage, we can do
that as:
```sh
./run_tpcc_on_clients kill
```

## Step 8. Aggregate results from the various clients.
We can aggregate the TPM-C from the various clients as follows:
```sh
grep -i "tpm-c" /tmp/*execute*txt | awk '{print $4}' | paste -s -d+ - | bc 
```
